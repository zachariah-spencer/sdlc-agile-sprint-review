# The final project coursework for SNHU's CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course.

Through this course, I learned:

Interpreting user needs in software development involves understanding what users want and implementing those insights into a program. This is done through stakeholder interviews, surveys, and user testing to gather information, while user stories offer a clear and concise way to communicate requirements. A user story, typically formatted as "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [reason]", helps developers focus on delivering valuable features and facilitates prioritization and planning. This approach allows teams to build software that closely aligns with users' needs, leading to more successful outcomes.

When it comes to program development, adopting agile methodologies is key. Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban promote iterative development, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous improvement. Practices such as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) ensure code quality and speed up release cycles. Being a good team member involves collaboration, accountability, adaptability, and respect. These qualities foster a positive environment where teams can work effectively and support each other, ultimately contributing to successful software projects.
